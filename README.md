# xtab-opener

The xtabOpener opens XML-files with this schema (http://dbunit.sourceforge.net/components.html) with Microsoft Office Excel and enables editing them there. 
When clicking on the save button in Excel, all changes are written back to the xml-file; when closing Excel, the xtabOpener quits.
Files with the suffix .xtab are opened by the xtabOpener when double clicking on them. 
To create a new xtab-file, just create a new empty text-file and change its suffix to xtab.

To install the xtabOpener, use the setup.exe or Setup.msi stored in Setup/Release.
